## Phase 1: Complete Event System Implementation

- [x] Create a UserCreatedEvent class in users/domain/events.py
- [x] Implement user.created event publishing in UserService.create_user method
- [x] Create an email event handler in email module to send welcome emails
- [x] Update documentation for event system usage
- [x] Write tests for the event system implementation

### Summary of Completed Work

1. **Created UserCreatedEvent class**
   - Implemented in `app/modules/users/domain/events.py`
   - Extended the base EventBase class
   - Added fields for user_id, email, and full_name
   - Added a convenience publish method

2. **Implemented event publishing in UserService**
   - Updated `app/modules/users/services/user_service.py`
   - Added event publishing after successful user creation
   - Included relevant user data in the event

3. **Created email event handler**
   - Implemented in `app/modules/email/services/email_event_handlers.py`
   - Used the @event_handler decorator to subscribe to user.created events
   - Added handler to send welcome emails to new users

4. **Updated documentation**
   - Added comprehensive event system documentation to `backend/MODULAR_MONOLITH_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
   - Included examples, best practices, and architecture details
   - Documented the event flow between modules

5. **Wrote tests for the event system**
   - Created core event system tests in `tests/core/test_events.py`
   - Added user event tests in `tests/modules/users/domain/test_user_events.py`
   - Implemented email handler tests in `tests/modules/email/services/test_email_event_handlers.py`
   - Added integration tests in `tests/modules/integration/test_user_email_integration.py`

### Key Achievements

- Successfully implemented a loosely coupled event system
- Established a pattern for cross-module communication
- Improved separation of concerns between modules
- Created comprehensive tests for all components
- Documented the event system for future developers

### Next Steps

- Proceed to Phase 2: Finalize Alembic Integration
- Consider adding more domain events for other key operations
- Expand the event system to cover more use cases
