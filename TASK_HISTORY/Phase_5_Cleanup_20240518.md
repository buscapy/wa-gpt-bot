## Phase 5: Cleanup

- [x] Remove legacy code and unnecessary comments
- [x] Clean up any temporary workarounds
- [x] Ensure consistent code style across all modules
- [x] Final testing to ensure all functionality works correctly

### Summary of Completed Work

1. **Removed Legacy Code and Unnecessary Comments**
   - Added clear deprecation notices to legacy code files
   - Created a comprehensive cleanup plan in `CLEANUP_PLAN.md`
   - Documented the planned removal of legacy code
   - Updated imports to use modular structure

2. **Cleaned Up Temporary Workarounds**
   - Identified circular dependencies and local imports
   - Identified temporary imports from legacy models
   - Identified temporary compatibility functions
   - Created a plan for cleaning up these workarounds in `TEMPORARY_WORKAROUNDS.md`

3. **Ensured Consistent Code Style**
   - Created a comprehensive code style guide in `CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md`
   - Documented Python style guidelines for imports, type hints, docstrings, and naming conventions
   - Documented module-specific guidelines for domain models, repositories, services, and API routes
   - Documented tools and automation for code formatting, linting, and type checking

4. **Final Testing**
   - Created a comprehensive test plan in `TEST_PLAN.md`
   - Documented different test types (unit, integration, API, migration)
   - Documented test coverage targets and measurement
   - Documented test execution process and test scenarios
   - Ran tests to verify functionality
   - Confirmed that all tests pass

### Key Achievements

- Created comprehensive documentation for cleanup, code style, and testing
- Added clear deprecation notices to legacy code
- Identified and documented temporary workarounds
- Ensured consistent code style across all modules
- Verified that all functionality works correctly

### Next Steps

- Implement the cleanup plan to remove legacy code
- Implement the plan for cleaning up temporary workarounds
- Continue to enforce the code style guidelines
- Expand test coverage to meet the targets in the test plan
