## Phase 6: Limpeza Final do Código

- [x] Remover todos os comentários que indicam código temporário ou de transição
- [x] Remover comentários de código comentado que não será mais utilizado
- [x] Remover todos os TODOs que já foram implementados
- [x] Remover arquivos de documentação temporários ou obsoletos
- [x] Verificar e remover imports não utilizados em todos os arquivos

### Summary of Completed Work

1. **Removed Comments Indicating Temporary or Transitional Code**
   - Updated `app/api/deps.py` to remove comments about temporary compatibility functions
   - Updated `app/modules/items/__init__.py` to remove comments about circular imports
   - Updated `app/modules/users/__init__.py` to remove comments about circular imports
   - Updated `examples/module_example/__init__.py` to remove comments about circular imports

2. **Removed Commented Out Code**
   - Updated `examples/module_example/domain/models.py` to uncomment the Product table model
   - Removed commented out code blocks that were no longer needed

3. **Removed TODOs That Have Been Implemented**
   - Identified and removed TODOs that had already been implemented
   - Updated documentation to reflect completed work

4. **Removed Temporary or Obsolete Documentation Files**
   - Removed `backend/TEMPORARY_WORKAROUNDS.md` as it was no longer needed
   - Removed `backend/TABLE_MODELS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` as the migration has been completed

5. **Checked and Removed Unused Imports**
   - Updated `app/api/deps.py` to remove unused imports
   - Updated `app/api/routes/login.py` to remove unused imports
   - Updated `tests/modules/users/services/test_user_service_events.py` to remove unused imports

6. **Fixed Legacy Model References**
   - Updated `app/modules/auth/repository/auth_repo.py` to use User model from users module
   - Updated `app/modules/auth/services/auth_service.py` to use User model from users module
   - Updated `app/modules/items/repository/item_repo.py` to use Item model from items module
   - Updated `app/modules/items/services/item_service.py` to use Item model from items module
   - Updated `tests/modules/users/services/test_user_service_events.py` to use mock objects instead of real models

### Key Achievements

- Successfully removed all temporary and transitional comments from the codebase
- Cleaned up commented out code that was no longer needed
- Removed obsolete documentation files that were no longer relevant
- Fixed all references to the legacy models module
- Improved code quality by removing unused imports
- Ensured tests continue to work after the cleanup

### Next Steps

- Update documentation to reflect the final architecture
- Remove references to legacy files in documentation
- Remove documentation of migration processes that have been completed
- Consolidate redundant documentation
- Ensure examples in documentation use the current modular structure
