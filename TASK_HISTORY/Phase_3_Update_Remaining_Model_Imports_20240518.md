## Phase 3: Update Remaining Model Imports

- [x] Update remaining import references for non-table models
- [x] Develop strategy for table models (User, Item) migration
- [x] Implement the migration strategy for table models
- [x] Update tests to use the new model imports

### Summary of Completed Work

1. **Updated Import References for Non-Table Models**
   - Updated import references in API routes to use modular imports
   - Updated import references in tests to use modular imports
   - Verified that all non-table models can be imported from their respective modules
   - Created comprehensive tests for model imports

2. **Developed Strategy for Table Models Migration**
   - Created a detailed migration plan in `TABLE_MODELS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
   - Outlined a step-by-step approach for migrating table models
   - Identified potential issues and provided solutions
   - Created a rollback plan in case of issues

3. **Implemented Migration Strategy for Table Models**
   - Created `app/legacy_models.py` to house table models during transition
   - Updated `app/models.py` to import from `app/legacy_models`
   - Updated Alembic environment to use `app/legacy_models`
   - Updated module imports to use `app/legacy_models`
   - Verified that all tests pass with the new structure

4. **Updated Tests to Use New Model Imports**
   - Created tests for legacy models
   - Updated test fixtures to use `app/legacy_models`
   - Updated test imports to use modular imports
   - Verified that all tests pass with the new imports

### Key Achievements

- Successfully migrated all non-table models to their respective modules
- Created a clear path for migrating table models
- Implemented a transitional approach that maintains backward compatibility
- Updated tests to use the new modular structure
- Verified that all functionality works correctly with the new imports

### Next Steps

- Proceed to Phase 4: Documentation and Examples
- Update project README with information about the new architecture
- Add developer guidelines for working with the modular structure
- Create examples of extending the architecture with new modules
- Document the event system usage with examples
