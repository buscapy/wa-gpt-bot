## Phase 2: Finalize Alembic Integration

- [x] Update Alembic environment to import models from all modules
- [x] Test migration generation with the new modular structure
- [x] Create migration template for modular table models
- [x] Document Alembic usage in the modular structure

### Summary of Completed Work

1. **Updated Alembic Environment**
   - Modified `app/alembic/env.py` to import models from all modules
   - Maintained backward compatibility with legacy models
   - Added explicit imports for non-table models from each module
   - Ensured no duplicate table definitions

2. **Tested Migration Generation**
   - Verified that Alembic can detect models from all modules
   - Ensured that the migration process works with the modular structure
   - Identified and addressed import issues

3. **Created Migration Template**
   - Created `app/alembic/modular_table_migration_example.py` as a reference
   - Demonstrated how to create migrations for modular table models
   - Included examples of common migration operations

4. **Documented Alembic Usage**
   - Created `app/alembic/README_MODULAR.md` with comprehensive documentation
   - Explained the current hybrid approach during transition
   - Provided instructions for generating and applying migrations
   - Included troubleshooting tips and best practices

### Key Achievements

- Successfully integrated Alembic with the modular monolith architecture
- Maintained backward compatibility during the transition
- Provided clear documentation for future development
- Created templates and examples for future migrations

### Next Steps

- Proceed to Phase 3: Update Remaining Model Imports
- Complete the migration of all models to their respective modules
- Update all code to use the modular imports
- Remove legacy models from `app.models` once transition is complete
