## Phase 4: Documentation and Examples

- [x] Update project README with information about the new architecture
- [x] Add developer guidelines for working with the modular structure
- [x] Create examples of extending the architecture with new modules
- [x] Document the event system usage with examples

### Summary of Completed Work

1. **Updated Project README**
   - Added section about the modular monolith architecture
   - Documented the module structure and available modules
   - Added information about working with modules and legacy code
   - Updated the Migrations section to reflect the modular architecture
   - Added section about the event system

2. **Added Developer Guidelines**
   - Created `EXTENDING_ARCHITECTURE.md` with comprehensive guidelines
   - Provided detailed instructions for creating new modules
   - Added examples for module components (models, repository, service, API)
   - Included best practices for working with the modular architecture

3. **Created Examples**
   - Implemented a complete example module in `backend/examples/module_example/`
   - Demonstrated domain models and events
   - Implemented repository and service layers
   - Created API routes
   - Added event handlers to demonstrate cross-module communication
   - Created README to explain the example module

4. **Documented Event System**
   - Created `EVENT_SYSTEM.md` with comprehensive documentation
   - Explained the event system architecture
   - Added examples of defining, publishing, and subscribing to events
   - Included real-world examples of event flows
   - Added best practices for working with events

### Key Achievements

- Provided comprehensive documentation for the modular monolith architecture
- Created practical examples to help developers understand the architecture
- Documented best practices for working with the architecture
- Ensured that new developers can quickly understand and extend the system

### Next Steps

- Proceed to Phase 5: Cleanup
- Remove legacy code and unnecessary comments
- Finalize the modular monolith architecture
