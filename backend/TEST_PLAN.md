# Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for the modular monolith architecture.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests verify that individual components work as expected in isolation.

#### What to Test

- **Domain Models**: Validate model constraints and behaviors
- **Repositories**: Test data access methods
- **Services**: Test business logic
- **API Routes**: Test request handling and response formatting

#### Test Approach

- Use pytest for unit testing
- Mock dependencies to isolate the component being tested
- Focus on edge cases and error handling

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly.

#### What to Test

- **Module Integration**: Test interactions between components within a module
- **Cross-Module Integration**: Test interactions between different modules
- **Database Integration**: Test database operations
- **Event System Integration**: Test event publishing and handling

#### Test Approach

- Use pytest for integration testing
- Use test database for database operations
- Test complete workflows across multiple components

### 3. API Tests

API tests verify that the API endpoints work as expected.

#### What to Test

- **API Endpoints**: Test all API endpoints
- **Authentication**: Test authentication and authorization
- **Error Handling**: Test error responses
- **Data Validation**: Test input validation

#### Test Approach

- Use TestClient from FastAPI for API testing
- Test different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Test different response codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- Test with different input data (valid, invalid, edge cases)

### 4. Migration Tests

Migration tests verify that database migrations work correctly.

#### What to Test

- **Migration Generation**: Test that migrations can be generated
- **Migration Application**: Test that migrations can be applied
- **Migration Rollback**: Test that migrations can be rolled back

#### Test Approach

- Use Alembic for migration testing
- Test with a clean database
- Test with an existing database

## Test Coverage

The test suite should aim for high test coverage, focusing on critical components and business logic.

### Coverage Targets

- **Domain Models**: 100% coverage
- **Repositories**: 100% coverage
- **Services**: 90%+ coverage
- **API Routes**: 90%+ coverage
- **Overall**: 90%+ coverage

### Coverage Measurement

- Use pytest-cov to measure test coverage
- Generate coverage reports for each test run
- Review coverage reports to identify gaps

## Test Execution

### Local Testing

Run tests locally during development to catch issues early.

```bash
# Run all tests
bash ./scripts/test.sh

# Run specific tests
python -m pytest tests/modules/users/

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=app tests/
```

### CI/CD Testing

Run tests in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality before deployment.

- Run tests on every pull request
- Run tests before every deployment
- Block deployments if tests fail

## Test Plan Execution

   - Add unit tests for these components
   - Focus on critical business logic

### Phase 2: Integration Tests

1. **Run Existing Integration Tests**:
   - Run all existing integration tests
   - Fix any failing tests
   - Document test coverage

2. **Add Missing Integration Tests**:
   - Identify integration points with low test coverage
   - Add integration tests for these points
   - Focus on cross-module interactions

### Phase 3: API Tests

1. **Run Existing API Tests**:
   - Run all existing API tests
   - Fix any failing tests
   - Document test coverage

2. **Add Missing API Tests**:
   - Identify API endpoints with low test coverage
   - Add API tests for these endpoints
   - Focus on error handling and edge cases

### Phase 4: Migration Tests

1. **Test Migration Generation**:
   - Generate a test migration
   - Verify that the migration is correct
   - Fix any issues

2. **Test Migration Application**:
   - Apply the test migration to a clean database
   - Verify that the migration is applied correctly
   - Fix any issues

3. **Test Migration Rollback**:
   - Roll back the test migration
   - Verify that the rollback is successful
   - Fix any issues

### Phase 5: End-to-End Testing

1. **Test Complete Workflows**:
   - Identify key user workflows
   - Test these workflows end-to-end
   - Fix any issues

2. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Identify edge cases and error scenarios
   - Test these scenarios
   - Fix any issues

## Test Scenarios

### User Module

1. **User Registration**:
   - Register a new user
   - Verify that the user is created in the database
   - Verify that a welcome email is sent

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Log in with valid credentials
   - Verify that a token is returned
   - Verify that the token can be used to access protected endpoints

3. **User Profile**:
   - Get user profile
   - Update user profile
   - Verify that the changes are saved

4. **Password Reset**:
   - Request password reset
   - Verify that a reset email is sent
   - Reset password
   - Verify that the new password works

### Item Module

1. **Item Creation**:
