# Testing Strategy

This document provides an overview of the testing strategy for the modular monolith architecture. The testing approach is designed to ensure high-quality code and to maintain application stability through multiple layers of testing.

## Test Types

The test suite includes multiple types of tests, each serving a different purpose:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify that components work together correctly
3. **API Tests**: Ensure that API endpoints work as expected
4. **Blackbox Tests**: Test the application from an external client's perspective
5. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user flows from start to finish

## Testing Directory

Test files are organized following the module structure:

```
backend/
├── tests/
│   ├── conftest.py                 # Common test fixtures
│   ├── core/                       # Tests for core functionality
│   │   └── test_events.py
│   └── modules/                    # Tests for specific modules
│       ├── auth/
│       ├── users/
│       │   ├── domain/
│       │   └── services/
│       ├── items/
│       └── email/
```
